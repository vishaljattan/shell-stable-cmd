#Technique 2: to stable the reverse shell or bind shell
rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; 
however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. 
rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with 



sudo apt install rlwrap

rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>

Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. 
This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. 
When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: 
background the shell with Ctrl + Z, 
then use 

stty raw -echo; fg 

to stabilise and re-enter the shell.
